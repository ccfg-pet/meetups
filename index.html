<h1>Casual College Fitness Group</h1>
<p><em>SRJC Petalumaâ€™s walking meetup for students and employees. Itâ€™s low-pressure, midweek movement with good people and fresh air.</em></p>

<div class="post">
  <h2>ðŸ‘Ÿ Next Walk: Wednesday, September 10</h2>
  <p><strong>Time:</strong> 12:15 PM<br>
     <strong>Meeting Spot:</strong> Inside the cafeteriaâ€”just a few tables, a bar, and friendly faces. Look for someone stretching near the windows or sipping coffee with walking shoes on.<br>
     <strong>Route:</strong> Campus loop + wetlands trail (about 2 miles)<br>
     <strong>Pace:</strong> Casual and inclusiveâ€”no one gets left behind</p>
  <p>We know the campus feels quiet. Thatâ€™s why we walk. This group is welcome to all current SRJC Petaluma students and staff who want to move, connect, and take a midweek breather. No signup, no gear, no judgment. Just show up.</p>
